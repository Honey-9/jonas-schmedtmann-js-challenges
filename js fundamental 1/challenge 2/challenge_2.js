// Coding Challenge #2


// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
// improve it.


// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
//    is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
//    BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"


//    Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰

// Solution


let markMass = 78;
let markHeight =1.69;
let markBMI = markMass/ markHeight ** 2;


let johnMass = 92;
let JohnHeight = 1.95;
let johnBMI = johnMass/ JohnHeight ** 2;


if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI})!`)
}else{
  console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI})!`)
}
