// Coding Challenge #4


// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
// restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
// 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.



// Your tasks:

// 1.Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for 
//   this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement 😅(If it's easier for you, you can 
//   start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)

//   2.Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value 
//   (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
//    316.25”


// Test data:

// §Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430


// Hints:

// §To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2

// §Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300😉


// Solution

const bill1 = 275;
const bill2 = 40;
const bill3 = 430;

const tip1 = bill1 >= 50 && bill1 <= 300 ? bill1 * (15/100) : bill1 * .2 ;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill1}, the tip was ${tip1}, and the total value  ${bill1 + tip1}`  )

const tip3 = bill3 >= 50 && bill3 <= 300 ? bill3 * (15/100) : bill3 * .2 ;
console.log(`The bill was ${bill3}, the tip was ${tip3}, and the total value  ${bill3 + tip3}`  )
