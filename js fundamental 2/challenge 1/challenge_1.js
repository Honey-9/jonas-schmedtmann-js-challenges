// Coding Challenge #1


// Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new
// gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
// Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so
// one average score per team).
// A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team.
// Otherwise, no team wins!


// Your tasks:

// 1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
// 2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
// 3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
// as parameters ('avg Dolhins ' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
// to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
// Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
// 4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
// Data 2
// 5. Ignore draws this time
// Test data:


// Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
// Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

// Hints:

// § To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
// § To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
// Apply this to the team's average scores 😉


// Solutions

const calcAverage = (x, y, z) => (x + y +z)/3;
 
const dolphinScore = (calcAverage(44,23,71));
const koalaScore = (calcAverage(65,54,49));


function checkWinner(avgDolphins, avgKoalas) {

  if (avgDolphins >= 2 * avgKoalas) {
    console.log('Dolphins are the winner')
  }if (avgKoalas >= 2 * avgDolphins) {
    console.log('koalas are the winner')
  } else {
    console.log('No one wins')
  }  
}

checkWinner(dolphinScore, koalaScore);
